## 🔍 Common Errors & Fixes

### ERROR 1: Transport Error
```
WebChannelConnection RPC 'Write' stream transport errored
```

**Cause**: Firestore API not enabled

**Fix**:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/firestore.googleapis.com?project=mangeshrautarchive
2. Click **"ENABLE"**
3. Wait 1 minute
4. Test again

---

### ERROR 2: Permission Denied
```
permission-denied
Missing or insufficient permissions
```

**Cause**: Security rules not published

**Fix**:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/mangeshrautarchive/firestore/rules
2. Make sure rules show:
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /messages/{messageId} {
         allow create: if true;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Click **"Publish"** button
4. Wait for green "Published" status
5. Test again

---

### ERROR 3: CORS Error
```
Access to fetch... has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Cause**: Firestore API not allowing your domain

**Fix**:
This shouldn't happen with REST API, but if it does:
1. Check you're accessing from: https://mangeshraut712.github.io
2. Not from: localhost or other domain

---

### ERROR 4: API Key Error
```
API key not valid
Invalid API key
```

**Cause**: API key doesn't have Firestore permission

**Fix**:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=mangeshrautarchive
2. Click on "Browser key (auto created by Firebase)"
3. Under "API restrictions":
   - Select "Don't restrict key" (easiest)
   - OR select "Restrict key" and make sure "Cloud Firestore API" is checked
4. Click "Save"
5. Wait 1 minute
6. Test again

---

### ERROR 5: Network Error
```
Failed to fetch
Network request failed
```

**Cause**: Internet connection or browser blocking

**Fix**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Try different browser
3. Try incognito mode
4. Disable browser extensions (especially ad blockers)

---

## 🧪 Run Diagnostic Test

**In your terminal, run:**
```bash
node scripts/diagnose-firebase.js
```

This will test:
1. If Firestore API is accessible
2. If you can write to the database
3. What the exact error is

**Share the output with me!**

---

## 🔍 What To Share With Me

**Copy and paste these from your browser:**

1. **Full console output** when submitting form
2. **Network tab** - any failed requests (red)
3. **Any error messages** you see

**Example of what to copy:**
```
📬 Contact form initialized (Direct Firebase)
📝 Form data: {...}
🔥 Initializing Firebase...
❌ ERROR: [EXACT ERROR HERE]
```

## 🆘 Quick Checklist

Run through these:

- [ ] Is Firestore API enabled?
  - Check: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/firestore.googleapis.com?project=mangeshrautarchive
  - Should say "API enabled" or show "Manage" button

- [ ] Are security rules published?
  - Check: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/mangeshrautarchive/firestore/rules
  - Should show green "Published" status

- [ ] Is API key unrestricted or has Firestore API permission?
  - Check: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=mangeshrautarchive
  - "Browser key" should be unrestricted OR have Firestore API checked

- [ ] Did you hard refresh after code changes?
  - Press Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

- [ ] Is database in Native mode (not Datastore)?
  - Check: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/mangeshrautarchive/firestore
  - Should say "Cloud Firestore (Native mode)"

## 📸 Screenshots Needed

If you can't share console output, share screenshots of:

1. Browser console when form fails
2. Network tab (F12 → Network) showing failed requests
3. Firestore rules page showing "Published" status
4. API credentials page showing API key settings

---

## 🎯 Most Likely Causes

**90% of failures are:**
1. **Firestore API not enabled** ← Most common!
2. **Security rules not published**
3. **API key restrictions blocking Firestore**
4. **Browser cache** (need hard refresh)
5. **Still have transport errors** (API not enabled)

**Share the console error with me and I'll fix it immediately!** 🚀
