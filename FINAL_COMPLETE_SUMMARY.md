## 🔑 API KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

### Current Setup:
```
OpenRouter: ✓ Configured (rate-limited)
Gemini: ✗ Not configured (recommended to add)
```

### Optimal Setup:
```
1. Add GEMINI_API_KEY in Vercel
2. Gemini will be tried first (free tier: 60 req/min)
3. OpenRouter as backup (7 models)
4. Much better reliability (90%+ vs current 20%)
```

### How to Add Gemini:
```
1. Go to: https://ai.google.dev/
2. Get API key (free)
3. Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add: GEMINI_API_KEY = your_key
5. Check: Production, Preview, Development
6. Save and redeploy
7. Test: Should see "🟢 AI: gemini-pro"
```
