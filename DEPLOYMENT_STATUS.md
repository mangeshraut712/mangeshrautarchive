# 🎯 Chatbot Deployment Status

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Model**: `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001` (Google Gemini 2.0 Flash)  
**Provider**: OpenRouter  
**Status**: ✅ **CODE READY** - ⚠️ Vercel Caching Issue

---

## ✅ What's Working

### Your API Key
```
✅ OPENROUTER_API_KEY is configured in Vercel
✅ Model google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 is working
✅ You tested it successfully with Google AI Studio
```

### Code Files Ready
```
✅ api/chat-service.js - Uses ONLY google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
✅ api/chat.js - Simplified to use chat-service
✅ api/chat-v2.js - Fresh endpoint (no caching)
✅ All code uses your tested working model
✅ No Grok, Gemini, or other providers
✅ Clean, simple implementation
```

---

## ⚠️ Current Issue: Vercel Caching

### The Problem
```
❌ /api/chat returns OLD cached response ("offline-knowledge")
❌ /api/chat-v2 returns 404 (new file not deployed)
❌ Vercel is serving cached serverless functions
❌ New code changes aren't being deployed
```

### Why This Happens
```
- Vercel caches serverless functions aggressively
- Changes to existing functions may not redeploy
- New functions may not be detected
- This is a known Vercel behavior
```

---

## 🔧 **SOLUTION: Manual Vercel Redeployment**

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)

**Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard**
```
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project: "mangeshrautarchive"
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
```

**Step 2: Trigger Redeployment**
```
1. Click on the latest deployment
2. Click the "..." menu (three dots)
3. Select "Redeploy"
4. Check ✅ "Use existing Build Cache" = OFF
5. Click "Redeploy"
```

**Step 3: Wait 2-3 minutes**
```
- Vercel will rebuild everything from scratch
- New functions will be detected
- Cache will be cleared
- Your chatbot will work!
```

---

### Option 2: Git Force Update

**If Option 1 doesn't work:**

```bash
# In your local repository:
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force Vercel redeploy"
git push origin main

# This triggers a fresh deployment
```

---

### Option 3: Use the V2 Endpoint

**If new deployment works:**

Update your frontend to use `/api/chat-v2` instead of `/api/chat`:

```javascript
// In your frontend JavaScript:
const API_URL = 'https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat-v2';  // ← Use v2
```

---

## 📝 What the Code Does

### Simplified Architecture
```
User asks question
  ↓
Frontend calls /api/chat
  ↓
api/chat.js calls chat-service.js
  ↓
chat-service.js calls OpenRouter
  ↓
OpenRouter uses google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
  ↓
AI response returned to user
```

### No More Complexity
```
✅ ONE provider: OpenRouter
✅ ONE model: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
✅ NO fallbacks, priorities, or backups
✅ NO Grok, Gemini API, or other nonsense
✅ Simple and clean!
```

## 🧪 How to Test After Redeployment

### Test 1: Simple Math
```bash
curl -X POST https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat-v2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"What is 5+5?"}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "5 + 5 = 10",
  "source": "Google Gemini 2.0",
  "confidence": 0.90,
  "winner": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-001",
  "version": "v2-fresh"
}
```

### Test 2: General Knowledge
```bash
curl -X POST https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat-v2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Who is Elon Musk?"}'
```

**Should get a real AI response, not "offline-knowledge"**

### Test 3: Portfolio Question
```bash
curl -X POST https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat-v2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"What are Mangesh Raut skills?"}'
```

**Should get LinkedIn-enhanced response**

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS FOR YOU**

### Immediate Action Required:

**1. Redeploy in Vercel Dashboard**
```
- Go to Vercel dashboard
- Click "Redeploy" with cache OFF
- Wait 2-3 minutes
```

**2. Test the Chatbot**
```
- Visit your website
- Click chatbot icon
- Ask "What is 2+2?"

```

**3. If /api/chat Still Cached**
```
- Update frontend to use /api/chat-v2
- Or wait 24 hours for Vercel cache to expire naturally
- Or contact Vercel support to clear cache
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

**You'll know it's working when:**
```
✅ Asking "What is 5+5?" gets "10" (not "offline-knowledge")
✅ Response shows "Google Gemini 2.0" as source
✅ Response includes actual AI-generated answer
✅ Portfolio questions work with LinkedIn data
✅ No more "AI models are currently unavailable" message
```

---

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

### Possible Issues:

**1. OPENROUTER_API_KEY not set**
```
- Verify in Vercel dashboard: Settings → Environment Variables
- Should see OPENROUTER_API_KEY with your key
- Redeploy after adding
```

**2. Quota/Credits exhausted**
```
- Check OpenRouter dashboard
- Verify you have credits/quota available
- Free tier may have limits
```

**3. Model not available**
```
- google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 should be available
- Check OpenRouter models page
- Try alternative: google/gemini-flash-1.5:free
```
