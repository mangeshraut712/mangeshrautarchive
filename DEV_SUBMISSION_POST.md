## � Google AI Tools Used

### 1. ⚡ Google Antigravity (AI Development Environment)

I used **Google's Antigravity** throughout the entire development process to:

- **Rapidly prototype** the AI chatbot integration and streaming responses
- **Debug and optimize** Python FastAPI backend performance
- **Generate premium CSS** animations and glassmorphism effects
- **Write comprehensive documentation** and README files
- **Fix bugs** in real-time with AI-assisted debugging
- **Refactor code** for better architecture and maintainability

Antigravity was my pair-programming partner, helping me ship features 10x faster!

### 2. 🤖 Google Gemini API (via AI Studio)

My portfolio's AI assistant connects to the **Gemini API** through Google AI Studio:

- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** — Fast, intelligent responses
- **Streaming responses** — Real-time character-by-character output
- **Context-aware conversations** — Multi-turn memory for natural dialogue
- **Fallback intelligence** — Works even when primary models are unavailable

### 3. ☁️ Google Cloud Run

The portfolio is fully deployed on **Google Cloud Run**:

```bash
# Deployed with the challenge label
gcloud run deploy mangesh-portfolio-api \
    --labels dev-tutorial=devnewyear2026
```

**Cloud Run Benefits:**
- ⚡ Auto-scaling serverless containers
- 🔒 HTTPS by default
- 🌐 Global edge network
- 💰 Pay-per-use pricing
