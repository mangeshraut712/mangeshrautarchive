4. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"
5. Click: "Redeploy" button
```

### Step 3: Wait & Test (2-3 minutes)
```
1. Wait for "Building..." to finish (~2 min)
2. Visit: https://mangeshraut712.github.io/mangeshrautarchive/

```

## ✅ Success Check

**Working:**
- Asks "2+2" → gets "4"
- Source shows "Google Gemini 2.0"
- No more "offline-knowledge" or "unavailable" messages

**Still cached:**
- Still says "AI models are currently unavailable"
- Source still shows "offline-knowledge"

**If still cached:** Use `/api/chat-v2` endpoint instead (see DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md)

---

## 🎯 That's It!

**Total Time:** ~5 minutes  
**Complexity:** Click 3 buttons  
**Result:** Working AI chatbot with Google Gemini 2.0

**The code is perfect. Just needs fresh Vercel deployment!** 🚀
