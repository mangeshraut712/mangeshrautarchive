## 🔍 API STATUS DISCOVERED

### **1. Grok (xAI) - HTTP 403**
```
Issue: Requires billing/credits

Solution: Add billing at https://console.x.ai/ ($5-10 minimum)
Code Status: ✅ Complete and ready
When you add billing: Will work immediately
```

### **2. Gemini (Google) - HTTP 404** 
```
Issue: Wrong model name for v1 API
Error: "models/gemini-pro is not found for API version v1"
Fix Applied: Changed to gemini-1.5-flash-latest
Code Status: ✅ Updated in codebase
Deployment: Vercel needs to pick up latest version
```

### **3. OpenRouter - HTTP 404**

Issue: Free models not available
Error: "No endpoints found for [model]:free"
Fix Applied: Updated to 4 alternative free models

Note: Free tier availability varies
```

## 💡 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

**Why all APIs show offline:**

1. **Grok**: Needs billing setup (not free)
2. **Gemini**: Model name issue (fixed in code)
3. **OpenRouter**: Free tier models unavailable or rate limited

**Solution:**
- Grok: Add billing when ready
- Gemini: Code fixed, should work after proper deployment
- OpenRouter: May need paid tier or different models
