---

## 🎊 BREAKING NEWS: Vercel is LIVE!

After 10+ deployment attempts, Vercel is now successfully deployed!

### **Proof from Terminal Tests:**

```bash
# Homepage Test
curl -I https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/
HTTP/2 200 ✅
last-modified: Sun, 12 Oct 2025 12:12:05 GMT ✅ (NEW!)

# API Status Test
curl https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/status
{"grok":{"available":true},...,"timestamp":"2025-10-12T12:12:16.893Z"} ✅

# Chat API Test  
curl -X POST https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"hello"}'
{"answer":"I'm an AI assistant...","type":"general"} ✅
```

## ⚠️ One Final Step: OpenRouter API Key

### Current Behavior
The chat API is responding but using **offline fallback**:
```json
{
  "answer": "I'm an AI assistant...",
  "source": "offline-knowledge",  ← Using fallback
  "confidence": 0.3                ← Low confidence
}
```

### Why This Happens
OpenRouter API key is not set in Vercel environment variables.

### How to Fix (2 minutes)

**In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:**

1. Click "Add Variable"
2. Name: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
3. Value: [Your OpenRouter API key from openrouter.ai]
4. Environments: ✓ Production ✓ Preview ✓ Development
5. Click "Save"
6. Go to Deployments → Redeploy (important!)

### After Adding API Key

Test again:
```bash
curl -X POST https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Who is the CEO of Apple?"}'
```

**Expected Response** (with OpenRouter):
```json
{
  "answer": "Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple Inc. since 2011...",
  "source": "openrouter (meta-llama/...)",  ← OpenRouter!
  "confidence": 0.82,                        ← High confidence
  "providers": ["OpenRouter"],
  "winner": "OpenRouter"
}
```

## 🧪 Test Full Integration

### Option 1: Use Test Page (Recommended)
```
https://mangeshraut712.github.io/mangeshrautarchive/test-api-integration.html
```

**What to expect NOW:**
- ✅ Test 1: /api/status → Should pass (green ✅)
- ✅ Test 2: /api/chat → Should pass (green ✅) 
- ✅ Test 3: CORS → Should pass (green ✅)

All three tests should now work!

### Option 2: Use Main Site
```
https://mangeshraut712.github.io/mangeshrautarchive/
```

**What to do:**
1. Open site
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for:
   ```
   ✅ Vercel API configured - hybrid mode enabled
   🖥️ Calling API: https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat
   ✅ API response received
   ```
4. Type "hello" in chat
5. Should get response (offline or OpenRouter depending on key)

### Option 3: Test Voice Mode
1. Click 🎤 microphone icon
2. Allow microphone
3. Say "What is your experience?"
4. Should get text + audio response
