🔴 AI Offline            ← No API keys or errors

### 2. **Dual API Provider Support** 🔷⚡

**Priority Order:**
1. **Gemini API** (tried first if key available)
2. **OpenRouter** (7 models with fallback)
3. **Offline mode** (basic responses)

**Logic:**
```javascript
if (GEMINI_API_KEY) {
    Try Gemini API
    if (success) return response;
}

if (OPENROUTER_API_KEY) {
    Try OpenRouter models (7 options)
    if (any succeed) return response;
}

Return offline fallback with rate limit message;
```

---

### 3. **User Notifications** 💬

**When Rate Limited:**
```
⚠️ AI models are currently rate-limited (free tier limit reached). 
The AI will be back when limits reset. You can still ask questions 
and I'll respond with basic knowledge.
```

**When AI Online:**
```
Response includes:
- statusMessage: "🟢 AI Online"
- rateLimit: false
- Shows model name in metadata
```
