## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Vercel Isn't Deploying

**Possible Reasons**:

1. **Auto-Deploy Disabled**
   - Vercel project settings may have auto-deploy turned off
   - Need to check: Settings → Git → Auto-Deploy

2. **Wrong Production Branch**
   - Vercel may be watching a different branch
   - Need to verify: Settings → Git → Production Branch = `main`

3. **GitHub Webhook Not Working**
   - Webhook may not be configured or failing
   - Check: GitHub repo → Settings → Webhooks

4. **Vercel Build Failing**
   - Builds may be failing silently
   - Need to check: Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Build Logs

5. **Project Not Linked to GitHub**
   - Git integration may be disconnected
   - Need to verify: Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Git

---

## 🎯 Required Actions

### **CRITICAL - Must Do Immediately**

#### Step 1: Login to Vercel Dashboard
```
https://vercel.com/dashboard
```

#### Step 2: Select Your Project
- Click on `mangeshrautarchive` project

#### Step 3: Check Deployments Tab
- Look for recent deployment attempts
- Check if any failed
- Review error messages in build logs

#### Step 4: Check Git Settings
- Go to: Settings → Git
- Verify:
  - ✓ Production Branch = `main`
  - ✓ Auto-Deploy = Enabled
  - ✓ GitHub repository connected

#### Step 5: Manual Redeploy
- Go to: Deployments tab
- Find any previous deployment
- Click "..." menu → "Redeploy"
- **IMPORTANT**: Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"
- Click "Redeploy"

#### Step 6: Watch Build Progress
- Wait for build to complete (1-3 minutes)
- Check build logs for errors
- Verify deployment shows "Ready"

## 📋 After Manual Deployment - Run These Tests

### Test 1: Verify Deployment Timestamp
```bash
curl -I https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/
# Look for: last-modified: [TODAY's DATE]
```

### Test 2: API Status Endpoint
```bash
curl https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/status
# Expected: JSON with API status
```

### Test 3: CORS Headers
```bash
curl -I -X OPTIONS \
  -H "Origin: https://mangeshraut712.github.io" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat

# Expected headers:
# HTTP/2 204 (or 200)
# Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://mangeshraut712.github.io
# Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS
```

### Test 4: Chat API
```bash
curl -X POST https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: https://mangeshraut712.github.io" \
  -d '{"message":"Hello, test message"}'

# Expected: JSON response with AI answer
```
