## 🧪 **AFTER YOU ADD KEYS - TEST**

### **Option 1: Test on Website**
```
1. Go to: https://mangeshraut712.github.io/mangeshrautarchive/
2. Open chatbot
3. Ask: "What is 5+5?"
4. Check response source

EXPECTED: "source": "grok (grok-beta)" or "grok (grok-2-latest)"
```

### **Option 2: Test in Terminal**
```bash
curl -X POST https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"What is 5+5?"}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "5 + 5 equals 10.",
  "source": "grok (grok-beta)",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "winner": "grok-beta",
  "statusMessage": "🟢 AI Online (Grok)"
}
```

## 📝 **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### **About API Keys:**
- ✅ NO quotes around the key value
- ✅ NO spaces before/after
- ✅ Must check ALL 3 environments
- ✅ Must redeploy after adding

### **Common Mistakes:**
```
❌ Wrong: "xai-abc123..."  (has quotes)
❌ Wrong:  xai-abc123...   (has space before)
❌ Wrong: xai-abc123       (incomplete key)
✅ Right: xai-abc123def456... (raw key, no quotes/spaces)
```

### **If Keys Don't Work:**
1. Double-check the key value is correct
2. Make sure you selected all 3 environments
3. Try deleting and re-adding the variable
4. Redeploy manually from Deployments tab
5. Wait 3 full minutes after deploy
6. Clear browser cache and test

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED: Start with Grok**

**Minimum to get started:**
```
Just add GROK_API_KEY and your chatbot will work!

The code will:
- Try Grok first (your preference)
- If Grok works → Great! Use it
- If Grok fails → Show offline (until you add other keys)
```

**For full redundancy:**
```
Add all 3 keys (Grok + Gemini + OpenRouter)
Then you have 3-tier backup system!
```
