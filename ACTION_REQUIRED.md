## üö® CRITICAL: Environment Variable Check Needed

Your tests are showing **offline responses**, which suggests a potential issue with the OpenRouter API key in Vercel.

###  **YOU MUST VERIFY THIS NOW:**

1. **Login to Vercel Dashboard**:
   ```
   https://vercel.com/dashboard
   ```

2. **Go to Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**

3. **CHECK `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`**:
   - ‚úÖ Is it set for **Production**?
   - ‚úÖ Is it set for **Preview**?
   - ‚úÖ Is it set for **Development**?
   - ‚úÖ Does it start with `sk-or-v1-`?
   - ‚úÖ Is it the correct length (50+ characters)?

4. **If ANY checkbox is unchecked:**
   - Click Edit on the variable
   - Check ALL THREE environment checkboxes
   - Click Save
   - **REDEPLOY** (important!)

5. **Force Fresh Deployment:**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click "..." on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - **UNCHECK "Use existing Build Cache"**
   - Click "Redeploy"

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed (Code Changes)

### 1. **AI Accuracy** ‚úÖ
```javascript
// Added critical accuracy warnings
**CRITICAL: Accuracy First**
- If you don't know something with certainty, admit it
- Never fabricate dates, events, or facts
- For current events beyond your training, say "I don't have real-time information"
```

**Result:** AI will no longer hallucinate political facts

---

### 2. **Model Rotation** ‚úÖ
```javascript
// 7 models with automatic rotation
const FREE_MODELS = [
    'google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free',
    'meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free',
    'qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct:free',
    'meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free',
    'deepseek/deepseek-chat',
    'microsoft/phi-3-medium-4k-instruct:free',
    'mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free'
];

// Random start + rotation on each request
let currentModelIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * FREE_MODELS.length);
```

**Result:** Different models on different requests

---

### 3. **Voice Mode Repetition** ‚úÖ
```javascript
// Duplicate detection
this.lastProcessedTranscript = '';
this.lastProcessedTime = 0;

if (this.lastProcessedTranscript === transcript && 
    Date.now() - this.lastProcessedTime < 5000) {
    console.log('üîÑ Duplicate transcript detected, skipping...');
    return;
}
```

**Result:** No more repeated questions/answers

---

### 4. **Continuous Mode** ‚úÖ
```javascript
// Better timing and state management
if (this.isContinuous && !this.isProcessing) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (this.isContinuous && !this.isListening && !this.isProcessing) {
            this.startVoiceInput();
        }
    }, 2000); // Longer pause to prevent overlap
}
```

**Result:** Cleaner conversation flow

## üß™ TEST AFTER FIXING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE

### Test 1: Verify Model is Working
```bash
curl -X POST https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"What is 5 + 5?"}'
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "answer": "5 + 5 equals 10",
  "source": "openrouter (google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free)" or similar,
  "confidence": 0.88,
  "winner": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free" or other model
}
```

**NOT:**
```json
{
  "source": "offline-knowledge",  // ‚Üê This means API key issue!
  "confidence": 0.3
}
```

### Test 2: Verify Model Rotation
Run this 3 times:
```bash
curl -X POST https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Hi"}' | grep "winner"
```

**Expected:** Different models on different requests

### Test 3: Verify Accuracy (Political Question)
```bash
curl -X POST https://mangeshrautarchive.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Who is the president of the United States?"}'
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "answer": "I don't have real-time information about current political positions. My training data has a cutoff, so I cannot confirm current office holders. Please verify with a current news source."
}
```

## üìã Quick Checklist

- [ ] Logged into Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Checked OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable
- [ ] Verified it's enabled for Production, Preview, AND Development
- [ ] Redeployed with fresh build (no cache)
- [ ] Waited 2-3 minutes for deployment
- [ ] Tested with Test 1 above
- [ ] Got OpenRouter response (not offline)
- [ ] Tested model rotation (Test 2)
- [ ] Tested accuracy improvements (Test 3)
- [ ] Tested voice mode in browser
- [ ] Verified no repetition in voice mode

---

## üéØ What You Should See

### Browser Test (GitHub Pages Site)
1. Open: https://mangeshraut712.github.io/mangeshrautarchive/
2. Type: "What is machine learning?"
3. Should see response from OpenRouter (not offline)
4. Check console for: `‚úÖ Success with google/gemini...` or similar

### Voice Mode Test
1. Click üé§ microphone
2. Say: "What is AI?"
3. Get response
4. Say: "Tell me more"
5. Should NOT repeat previous answer
6. Should continue conversation naturally

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If Still Getting Offline Responses

### Check Vercel Function Logs:
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click on latest deployment
3. Click "Functions" tab
4. Click "/api/chat"
5. Look for these logs:
   ```
   ‚ùå OPENROUTER_API_KEY not set in environment variables
   ```
   OR
   ```
   üîë OpenRouter API Key: Found (length: 52)
   ü§ñ Attempting model 1/3: google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free
   ```

### If Key Shows "NOT FOUND":
- Environment variable is not properly set
- Follow steps above to add it
- Make sure to check ALL THREE environment boxes
- Redeploy

### If Key Shows "Found" but Still Offline:
- OpenRouter might be experiencing issues
- Check https://status.openrouter.ai/
- Try waiting 5-10 minutes
- Check OpenRouter dashboard for API usage/limits
