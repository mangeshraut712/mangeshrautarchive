# üîç Actual Issue Found

## The Real Problem

You're RIGHT - Vercel IS deploying with every commit.

The issue is NOT deployment.
The issue is a RUNTIME ERROR in the deployed code.

## Evidence

API Test Shows:
- ‚úÖ Vercel is deployed (CORS headers correct)
- ‚ùå Function crashes with 500 (runtime error)

Possible Causes:
1. OPENROUTER_API_KEY not set in Vercel env
2. Import error in backend
3. Async/await error
4. Missing dependency

## Next Steps

Check Vercel environment variables:
- Is OPENROUTER_API_KEY set?

I'll investigate the actual runtime error now instead of saying "redeploy".
