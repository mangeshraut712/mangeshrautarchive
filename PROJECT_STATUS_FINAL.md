## 🎤 VOICE MODE STATUS

### Improvements Made
✅ Duplicate detection (5-second window)  
✅ Processing locks to prevent overlap  
✅ Better continuous mode timing  
✅ S2R-inspired configuration  
✅ Visual state animations  
✅ Improved error handling  

### Known Issues
⚠️ May still repeat in some edge cases  
⚠️ Needs live browser testing to confirm  
⚠️ Continuous mode timing may need adjustment  

### Recommendations
1. Test in Chrome/Edge (best support)
2. Use HTTPS (required for voice API)
3. Allow microphone permissions
4. Test with clear speech

## 🤖 AI SYSTEM STATUS

### Current Configuration
```
Provider: OpenRouter
API Key: Configured in Vercel
Models: 7 free-tier models
Rotation: Random selection
Fallback: Offline mode
```

### Model List
1. `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`
2. `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free`
3. `qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct:free`
4. `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`
5. `deepseek/deepseek-chat`
6. `microsoft/phi-3-medium-4k-instruct:free`
7. `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free`

### Rate Limiting Issue
**Cause:** OpenRouter free tier limits  
**Impact:** 40-60% requests go to offline fallback  
**Solutions:**
1. Wait for rate reset (hourly/daily)
2. Upgrade OpenRouter plan ($0.50+/month)
3. Add alternative providers
4. Implement request queueing
