## 📝 What's Working

### ✅ GitHub Pages (Frontend)

**Verified Working**:
1. ✅ Homepage loads (HTTP 200)
2. ✅ New CSS paths work (`assets/css/`)
3. ✅ New image paths work (`assets/images/`)
4. ✅ New JS paths work (`js/core/`, `js/utils/`, `js/modules/`)
5. ✅ Resume PDF accessible (`assets/files/`)
6. ✅ Research paper accessible (`assets/files/`)
7. ✅ Old paths correctly return 404
8. ✅ Structure is clean and organized

**Test it yourself**:
```bash
# Visit the live site
https://mangeshraut712.github.io/mangeshrautarchive/

# Test assets
https://mangeshraut712.github.io/mangeshrautarchive/assets/css/style.css
https://mangeshraut712.github.io/mangeshrautarchive/assets/images/profile.jpg
https://mangeshraut712.github.io/mangeshrautarchive/js/core/script.js
```

All return HTTP 200! ✅

### ⚠️ Vercel (Backend)

**Current State**:
- ✅ Vercel is online
- ✅ API endpoints respond
- ⚠️ Serving OLD cached code
- ⏳ Waiting for redeploy (100/day limit reached)

**Why Cached**:
- Vercel hit 100 deployments/day limit
- Cannot redeploy for 8 hours (until midnight UTC)
- Last successful deploy was before refactor
- New code is committed but not deployed yet

**What Happens After Redeploy**:
1. Vercel detects new commits
2. Rebuilds with new code
3. Deploys new serverless functions
4. Chat will return new format ✅
