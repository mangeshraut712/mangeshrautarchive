```
1. Wait 8 hours (limit resets at midnight UTC)
2. Vercel may auto-deploy latest commit
3. Test your chatbot immediately
4. Should work with new format!
```

### Option B: Manual Redeploy

```
1. Wait 8 hours for limit reset
2. Go to Vercel Dashboard
3. Deployments → Click "..." → Redeploy
4. Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"
5. Click "Redeploy"
6. Wait 2-3 minutes
7. Test chatbot!
```
