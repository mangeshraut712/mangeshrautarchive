### Test 13: "What is Mangesh's highest qualification?"

**Issue**: AI says "Master of Science" (incorrect - still in progress)  
**Expected**: "Bachelor's degree (2017), currently pursuing Master's"

**Root Cause**: System prompt needs stronger emphasis on completed vs in-progress

**Recommendation**: Update system prompt with:
```
HIGHEST COMPLETED qualification: Bachelor's in Computer Engineering (2017)
CURRENTLY PURSUING: Master's in Computer Science (expected 2025)
When asked about "highest qualification", always mention COMPLETED degree first.
