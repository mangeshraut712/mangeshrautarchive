# 🧪 Test Results: Before vs After Deployment

---

## ❌ Current Results (OLD Cached Version)

### Test 1: Math Question
```bash
curl -X POST .../api/chat -d '{"message":"What is 25 + 37?"}'
```

**Current Response (Cached OLD code):**
```json
{
  "answer": "⚠️ AI models are currently unavailable. Please try again in a moment.",
  "source": "offline-knowledge",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "processingTime": 732,
  "type": "general",
  "providers": [],
  "winner": "OpenRouter"
}
```

❌ **Issues:**
- No real AI response
