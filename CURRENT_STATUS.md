1. Grok (xAI) - Failing
2. Gemini - Failing  
3. OpenRouter - Failing
```

---

## 🔑 **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES TO CHECK IN VERCEL**

### **Required Variables:**
```
1. GROK_API_KEY (or XAI_API_KEY)
   - Your primary choice
   - Should start with: xai-
   - Length: ~60-80 characters

2. GEMINI_API_KEY
   - Google Gemini backup
   - Optional but recommended

3. OPENROUTER_API_KEY  
   - Last resort backup
   - Optional
```

### **How to Verify in Vercel:**
```
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select: mangeshrautarchive project
3. Click: Settings → Environment Variables
4. Check each variable:
   ✓ Name is correct (GROK_API_KEY or XAI_API_KEY)
   ✓ Value is your updated key
   ✓ All 3 checkboxes: Production, Preview, Development
5. If missing/wrong: Add or update
6. Redeploy: Deployments → ⋯ → Redeploy
```

## 🧪 **HOW TO CHECK VERCEL LOGS**

### **Step 1: Access Logs**
```
1. Vercel Dashboard → mangeshrautarchive
2. Deployments tab
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. Functions tab
5. Click on /api/chat
6. View function logs
```

### **Step 2: What to Look For**
```
Look for these log messages:

GOOD LOGS (means key is found):
🔑 Grok (xAI) API Key: Found (length: 78)
🚀 Trying Grok (xAI) with latest model...
✅ Grok grok-2-1212 success (2500ms)

BAD LOGS (means key is missing):
🔑 Grok (xAI) API Key: NOT FOUND - CRITICAL!
❌❌ GROK_API_KEY NOT FOUND IN VERCEL!
```

### **Step 3: Check for Errors**
```
If you see errors like:
- "401 Unauthorized" → Wrong API key
- "429 Rate Limited" → Free tier exhausted  
- "404 Not Found" → Wrong endpoint
- "Invalid model" → Model name issue
```

## 🎯 **DEPLOYED CODE STRUCTURE**

### **Priority Flow:**
```javascript
1. Try Grok (xAI)
   if (GROK_API_KEY) {
       tryGrok() with grok-2-1212
       if success → return response
   }

2. Try Gemini
   if (GEMINI_API_KEY) {
       tryGemini() with gemini-1.5-flash
       if success → return response
   }

3. Try OpenRouter
   if (OPENROUTER_API_KEY) {
       tryOpenRouter() with 4 models
       if success → return response
   }

4. Return Offline
   return "⚠️ AI models are currently unavailable"
