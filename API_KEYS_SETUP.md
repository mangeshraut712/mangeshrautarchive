# 🔑 API Keys Configuration Guide

## Overview
Your portfolio website integrates with multiple AI services for an intelligent chatbot experience. This guide explains how API keys are securely handled for both local development and GitHub Pages deployment.

## 🚀 Repository Secrets (Required)

Set these secrets in your GitHub repository settings (Settings → Secrets → Actions):

### Required Secrets:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY      # Claude AI API key from Anthropic
GROK_API_KEY          # Grok xAI API key
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY    # Perplexity AI API key
```

### How to Add Secrets:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New repository secret**
5. Add each secret above with their respective values

## 🎯 How It Works

### GitHub Pages Deployment (Production)
- **GitHub Actions** automatically builds your site during deployment
- **Secrets are embedded** into a production config file at build time
- **API keys are installed** in the static JavaScript bundle
- **Website works** without external dependencies

### Local Development
- Use the `run-test.sh` script to start development with API keys
- Create a `.env` file with your API keys locally:
  ```bash
  GROK_API_KEY=your-grok-key-here
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key-here
  PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-key-here
  ```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 🔧 Testing Configuration
```bash
# Test if API keys are properly configured
node test-config.js
```

### 👨‍💻 Local Development
```bash
# Run development server with API keys
./run-test.sh
```

### 🚀 Production Build
```bash
# Build for GitHub Pages deployment
npm run build
```

## 📁 File Structure

```
├── js/
│   ├── config.local.js      # ✅ Generated by build process (GitHub Actions only)
│   ├── services.js          # 🤖 Core AI services
│   └── config.js           # ⚙️  Base configuration

├── test-config.js          # 🔍 Configuration tester
└── run-test.sh            # 🏃 Development runner
```

## ⚠️ Security Notes

- ✅ **API keys are NEVER committed** to the repository
- ✅ **Local .env files are ignored** by .gitignore
- ✅ **Production keys embedded** securely during build time only
- ❌ **Never push API keys** to any repository
- ❌ **Don't share keys** in public spaces

## 🎉 Benefits

- 🔒 **Secure**: API keys never exposed in source code
- 🚀 **Automatic**: Zero manual configuration needed
- 🌍 **Universal**: Works on any static hosting platform
- 🧪 **Testable**: Easy local development and testing
- 🔄 **CI/CD**: Automated deployment with GitHub Actions

## 🤖 Chatbot Features (API-Powered)

Your portfolio chatbot now supports:
- 🔥 **Grok xAI** (primary, latest AI model)
- 🤖 **Claude (Anthropic)** (fallback for reliability)
- 🔍 **Real-time knowledge** (Wikipedia, DuckDuckGo, Stack Overflow)
- 💾 **Portfolio-aware** responses about your experience
- 📊 **Intelligent routing** to appropriate AI services

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Chatbot Not Working
1. Check `node test-config.js` output
2. Verify GitHub secrets are set correctly
3. Check GitHub Actions deployment logs
4. Ensure API keys are valid and have credits

### Local Development Issues
1. Create `.env` file with API keys
2. Run `./run-test.sh` (not just `npm run dev`)
3. Check browser console for errors

### API Key Not Found
- GitHub Actions: Check repository secrets
- Local dev: Verify `.env` file exists and is loaded

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for deployment errors
2. Run `node test-config.js` to verify configuration
3. Ensure all required secrets are set in repository settings
